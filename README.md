# TokenVesting
https://tokenvesting.finance

Built during the DAO Global Hackathon 2021.

## Features
- easily setup a vesting contract for any ERC20 token
- UI to deposit ERC20 tokens to fund the vesting contract
- add vesting flows to any address
- supports more than one vesting flow per address
- each flow can have a different cliff (starting date), duration
- flows can be added at any time, on an ongoing basis
- launch and stop flows as needed, from the Flows listing screen
- dashboard displays stats and graphs of flows and token balances
- new team members can be added so others can manage vesting flows (3 permission levels)

## Next Steps
- gather feedback -- are there any missing features?
- consider adding a small fee, perhaps 0.1% of flow rate?
- Polygon launch
